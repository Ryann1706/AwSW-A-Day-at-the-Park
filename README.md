# AwSW-A-Day-at-the-Park

NOTE: This requires MagmaLink to work, which can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink), or on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243)

The purpose of this mod is to add some much-needed wholesome Amely and Vara content into the game. 
As the name suggests, you get to spend the day in the park with Adine, Remy, Amely, and Vara.

Requirements:
In chapter 4, specifically on the first investigation, have three dates with Remy done, and deliver the PDA, or three dates with either Remy or Adine done, and deliver the eggs to the hatchery. You will then have an option on whether you play the mod content or not.
