# AwSW-A-Day-at-the-Park

NOTE: This requires MagmaLink to work, which can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink), or on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243)

As the name suggests, you get to spend the day in the park with Adine, Remy, Amely, and Vara, during the chapter 4 investigation.

This mod includes:
+ Much needed wholesome Amely and Vara content
+ A minigame
+ An adorable surprise that won’t be spoiled


Requirements:
In chapter 4, specifically for your first choice for the investigation, have three dates with Remy done, and deliver the PDA, or three dates with either Remy or Adine done, and deliver the eggs to the hatchery. You will then have an option on whether you play the mod content or not.


Thanks to Kolsavdür and 4onen for playtesting, and thanks for the good ideas from Kolsavdür as well.
